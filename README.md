# Overview
### Goal: 
infer subsurface turbulence velocity fields from 3 surface sensor points capturing the time series of the surface elevation. 

### Method 
We apply the SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED), which combines an LSTM (temporal encoder) with a shallow decoder (spatial mapping). We train in a compressed SVD basis to ease the training while keeping the relevant turbulence. Figure below shows the general outline. 
![Figures/SHRED_architecture.png](Figures/SHRED_architecture.png)

We input time series of surface elevation from three randomly placed surface sensor points into a two-layer LSTM. The LSTM encodes these input sequences into a latent representation of their temporal dynamics. This latent vector is then passed to a shallow decoder network (SDN), which maps it onto the velocity fields across depth. We do this in compressed space, by feeding into the SDN the compressed $\bV$ matrices of the SVD decomposition for the surface elevation and the subsurface velocity fields. These fields are used in training and validation not to learn the subsurface time dynamics but only to learn the mapping of the surface time dynamics onto the subsurface fields.



We quantify the reconstruction errors using five metrics:
- Comparison of planar RMS values of the velocity from (uncompressed) ground truth and reconstructed fields
- Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) of reconstruction fields as compared to (uncompressed) ground truth
- Power Spectral Density Error (PSDE) of spectra calculated from reconstructed turbulent fields, as compared to (uncompressed) ground truth
- Structural Similarity Measure Index (SSIM) of reconstructed fields as compared to (uncompressed) ground truth
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of reconstructed fields as compared to (uncompressed) ground truth

Details about the error metrics can be found in the manuscript. The functions that calculate these can be found in 'Processdata.py'. 

### Data 
DNS cases S1/S2 and experimental T-Tank cases E1/E2. Details about the turbulence statistics can be found in the manuscript.  

### Outputs
Plots for manuscript are generated in 'Run turbulence sensing SHRED.ipynb'. This include plots for
- SVD modes for DNS and experiments (Fig. 3-4)
- Loss profile during SHRED training (Fig. 5)
- Comparison of test data snapshots of ground truth, compressed fields and SHRED reconstruction (Fig. 6-7)
- Case-by-case comparison of ground truth and reconstructed instantaneous velocity RMS profiles in depth (Fig. 8)
- Error metric plot for SHRED reconstructions, showing depth-dependence of metrics such as NMSE, PSDE, SSIM & PSNR (Fig. 9)
- Comparison of ground truth vs reconstruction of time series of planar RMS velocity for test snapshots (Fig. 10)
- Comparison of PSD spectra for ground truth, compressed and reconstructed fields for all cases (Fig. 11)
- Analysis of rank-dependence of PSD spectra (Fig. 12, in Appendix A)
- Analysis of rank-dependence of error metrics (Fig. 13, in Appendix A)

## Data & folder structure
- Raw data (DNS / T-Tank) must be stored outside the repo. These can be found in the following DATAVIEW link [insert link]. Once dowloaded, we assume a folder structure where these are saved in the folders: \data\DNS or \data\experiments, located relative to code folder
- SVD decompositions for DNS and experimental planes are essential. These can be calculated from script. Once calculated, we assume a folder structure where these are saved in the folders: \data\DNS\SVD or \data\experiments\SVD, located relative to code folder
- SHRED calculations are saved and stored in \output\SHRED, located relative to code folder
- all error metrics are saved and stored in \output\error\, located relative to code folder


# Quickstart overview

1) Put precomputed artifacts into artifacts/ (or compute SVDs locally).

2) Set the path variables (see above).

3) Open Run turbulence sensing SHRED.ipynb and run all cells:

4) Pre-processing:
   - Once downloaded, load  DNS and experimental data from the folder: /data/DNS/raw or /data/exp/raw
   - Convert all data to same format, using .MAT files
   - Calculate (or load, if pre-saved) SVD for velocity fields and save to /data/DNS/SVD or /data/exp/SVD

5) SVD mode decompositon
   - Run plotter for SVD modes and turbulence spectrum

6) Run SHRED
   - Run the main SHRED calculation program. Outputs (V matrix of compressed and reconstruction) are saved to folder /output/SHRED

7) Post-SHRED analysis
   - Calculate depth-dependent error metrics (NMSE, PSDE, SSIM & PSNR) and u_RMS of ground truth and reconstruction, and save outputs to /output/metrics
   - Plot depth-dependend error metrics
   - Calculate and plot instantaneous vertical u_RMS profiles and save calculations to /output/metrics
   - Calculate and plot a chosen error metric time series
   - Calculate and plot PSD spectra for all cases (assumes 2 DNS and 2 experimental) for a chosen depth
   - Calculate, save and plot parametric analysis of rank-dependence of error metrics and PSD spectra. Calculations saved to /output/metrics.
